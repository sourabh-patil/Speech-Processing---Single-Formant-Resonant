# Speech-Processing---Single-Formant-Resonant
Given the following specification for a single-formant resonator, we want to obtain the transfer function of the filter H(z) from the relation between resonance frequency / bandwidth, and the pole angle / radius. Plot filter magnitude response (dB magnitude versus frequency) and impulse response.
F1 (formant) = 900 Hz
B1(bandwidth) = 200 Hz
Fs (sampling freq) = 16 kHz

To solve this question you need to know the 2 pole model i.e. single format resonant model. You will find about the it on internet easily. You need to know about this as you have to use given F1, B1, Fs to formulate the 2 pole model.
